# TimeWeb-Alpha

This is the pre-Django version of TimeWeb, made entirely in Python and developed during late 2019 to late 2020.
Yes, it is entirely text-based.
And yes, I used Pygame to display the graph visuals.

TimeWeb was my 2nd real coding project, hence the peculiar codebase and tech stack. Shut up.
